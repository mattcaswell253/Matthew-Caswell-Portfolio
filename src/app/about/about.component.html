        <p>I am a Jr. Developer located in the Seattle area. I received my General Associates Degree from Pierce College. I then started working full time when I tore my ACL playing basketball. I decided to go back to school and thats when I found my true passion for coding. I attended Epicodus in Seattle where I learned many skills including HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, C#, git hub, pair programming and much more.</p>
        <p>my other passions include sports, snowboarding and movies.</p>
        <p>after graduating from Epicodus I took part in a internship at Sqwad Sports Inc. where I was tasked with styling and fixing functionality on the admin side of their web application. I am a team oriented hardworking individual with great leadership ability and quick to learn new things.. testing</p>
