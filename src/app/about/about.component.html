        <p>I am a Front End Developer located in the Seattle area. I received my general Associates Degree from Pierce College in 2013. After working manual labor jobs and ultimately suffering a physically debilitating knee injury, I decided to explore new career options and thatâ€™s when I found my true passion for coding. I attended a six-month program at Epicodus in Seattle where I immersed myself 40 hours per week learning many new skills including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, C#, Angular git hub, pair programming and much more.</p>
        <p>After graduating from Epicodus I took part in an internship at Sqwad Sports Inc. based out of Portland, Oregon where I was tasked with styling and fixing functionality on the admin side of their web application. Aside from coding and technology, my other passions include sports, snowboarding, traveling and movies.</p>
        <p>I take pride in being a team-oriented, hardworking individual with great leadership ability and a knack for learning new things.</p>

          <p>Matt showed excellent skills both technically and in communication while working on our platform. His ability to communicate with his teammates & upper management set him apart from any intern we've had in the past and current ones. With this mix of skills he was able to implement & finish a key backend admin system that is being used by all of our current clients. He will be an asset to any team he joins."</p>
